## Development

The docs site is rendered using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, and a custom theme which borrows from the [Porter](https://github.com/deislabs/porter) and [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm-www) projects.

Commits to v1 are auto deployed to the live site via Netlify.
