## Development

The docs site is rendered using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, and a custom theme which borrows from the [Porter](https://github.com/getporter/porter) and [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm-www) projects.

Commits to the main branch are auto deployed to the site via Netlify.
