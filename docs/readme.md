# Brigade Docs

* Browse the [docs on GitHub](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/tree/v2/docs/content)
* Browse the [v2 staging docs website](https://v2--brigade-docs.netlify.app)

## Development

The docs site is rendered using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator, and a custom theme which borrows from the [Porter](https://github.com/getporter/porter) and [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm-www) projects.

Commits to the v2 branch are auto deployed to the staging site via Netlify.
