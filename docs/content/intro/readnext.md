# What to Read Next

Now that you've read all of the introductory material, we hope you are as enthusiastic as we are about Brigade.

Henceforth, the documentation will be more in-depth and contextual.  In the [Advanced Topics] sections, we'll
look at Brigade's [architecture and design], explore the different [roles of interaction] within Brigade,
dive into the [scripting guides], discuss [development on Brigade itself] and more.

As you peruse the documentation, if you notice a gap or area needing attention, please let us know by [filing an issue].

Happy reading!
