# What to Read Next

So you’ve read all the introductory material and have decided you’d like to keep using Brigade to test your applications. We’ve only just scratched the surface.

So what’s next?

Well, we’ve always been big fans of learning by doing. At this point you should know enough to start a project of your own and start fooling around. As you need to learn new tricks, come back to the documentation.

We’ve put a lot of effort into making Brigade's documentation useful, easy to read and as complete as possible. The rest of this document explains more about how the documentation works so that you can get the most out of it.

(Yes, this is documentation about documentation. Rest assured we have no plans to write a document about how to read the document about documentation.)

## How the documentation is organized

Brigade's main documentation is broken up into “chunks” designed to fill different needs:

The [introductory material][] is designed for people new to Brigade – or to web development on Kubernetes in general. It doesn’t cover anything in depth, but instead gives a high-level overview of how testing apps on Kubernetes “feels”.

The [topic guides][topics], on the other hand, dive deep into individual parts of Brigade. There are complete guides to Brigade's controller, sandbox engine, and much more. This is probably where you’ll want to spend most of your time; if you work your way through these guides you should come out knowing pretty much everything there is to know about Brigade.
