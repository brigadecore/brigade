# Getting Started

New to Brigade or looking to quickly get up to speed with v2? Well, you came to the right place: read this material to quickly get up and running.

## How the documentation is organized

Brigade's main documentation is broken up into “chunks” designed to fill different needs:

The introductory material presented here is designed for people new to Brigade. It doesn’t cover anything in depth, but instead gives a
high-level overview of how to deploy and interact with Brigade, how to create projects and how to write scripts that handle events.

The [topic guides], on the other hand, dive deep into individual parts of Brigade. There are complete guides to Brigade's
core components, scripting libraries, system roles and more.  This is probably where you’ll want to spend most of your time;
if you work your way through these guides you should come out knowing pretty much everything there is to know about Brigade.
