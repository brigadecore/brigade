In this QuickStart, you will install Brigade, create a project and execute it.

* [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
* [Install Brigade](#install-brigade)
* [Log in to Brigade](#log-in-to-brigade)
* [Create a Project](#create-a-project)
* [Trigger an Event](#trigger-an-event)

## Prerequisites

* [A development Kubernetes cluster](#create-a-cluster).
* [Brigade CLI](#install-the-brigade-cli) installed.
* [Helm] CLI v3+ installed.
* [kubectl] CLI installed.
* Free disk space. The installation requires sufficient free disk space and will fail if your disk is nearly full.

> Please take note that the default configuration is not secure and is not appropriate for any shared cluster.
> This configuration is appropriate for evaluating Brigade on a local development cluster, and should not be used in production.

### Create a Cluster

If you do not already have a development cluster, we recommend using [KinD].
KinD runs a Kubernetes cluster locally using [Docker].
[Minikube] also works well for local development.

1. Install [KinD]. See the KinD documentation for full installation instructions, below are instructions for common environments:

    **linux**
    ```bash
    curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.11.1/kind-linux-amd64
    chmod +x ./kind
    mv ./kind /usr/local/bin
    ```

    **macos with Homebrew**
    ```bash
    curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.11.1/kind-darwin-amd64
    chmod +x ./kind
    mv ./kind /usr/local/bin
    ```

    **windows**
    ```powershell
    mkdir -force $env:USERPROFILE\bin
    (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.11.1/kind-windows-amd64", "$ENV:USERPROFILE\bin\kind.exe")
    $env:PATH+=";$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
    ```

    The script above downloads kind.exe and adds it to your PATH for the current session.
    Add the following line to your [PowerShell Profile](https://www.howtogeek.com/126469/how-to-create-a-powershell-profile/) to make the change permanent.

    ```powershell
    $env:PATH+=";$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
    ```

1. Create a Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:
    ```
    kind create cluster
    ```

1. Verify that you can connect to the cluster using kubectl:
    ```
    kubectl cluster-info
    ```

### Install the Brigade CLI

Install the Brigade CLI, brig, by copying the appropriate binary from our releases page into a directory on your machine that is included in your PATH environment variable.

**linux**
```bash
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/brig https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta.1/brig-linux-amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/brig
```

**macos**
```bash
curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/brig https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta.1/brig-darwin-amd64
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/brig
```

**windows**
```powershell
mkdir -force $env:USERPROFILE\bin
(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/releases/download/v2.0.0-beta.1/brig-windows-amd64.exe", "$ENV:USERPROFILE\bin\brig.exe")
$env:PATH+=";$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
```

The script above downloads brig.exe and adds it to your PATH for the current session.
Add the following line to your [PowerShell Profile](https://www.howtogeek.com/126469/how-to-create-a-powershell-profile/) to make the change permanent.

```powershell
$env:PATH+=";$env:USERPROFILE\bin"
```

## Install Brigade

Install Brigade on your local development cluster. See our [Installation] instructions for full instructions suitable for production clusters.

1. Enable Helm's experimental OCI support by setting the `HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI` environment variable to 1.

    **posix**
    ```bash
    export HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
    ```

    **powershell**
    ```powershell
    $env:HELM_EXPERIMENTAL_OCI=1
    ```

1. Create a directory to store the Brigade Helm charts.

    **posix**
    ```bash
    mkdir -p ~/charts
    ```

    **powershell**
    ```powershell
    mkdir -force $env:USERPROFILE/charts
    ```

1. Run the following commands to install Brigade.

    ```
    helm chart pull ghcr.io/brigadecore/brigade:v2.0.0-beta.1
    helm chart export ghcr.io/brigadecore/brigade:v2.0.0-beta.1 -d ~/charts
    helm install brigade2 ~/charts/brigade --namespace brigade2 --create-namespace
    kubectl rollout status deployment brigade2-apiserver -n brigade2 --timeout 5m
    ```
    
    Wait for the Brigade deployment to be ready.
    If the deployment fails, proceed to the [installation troubleshooting](/intro/install/#troubleshooting) section.

Now that Brigade is running, you need to determine the address of the Brigade API so that you can use it later in this QuickStart:

### Port Forward a Local Cluster

If you are running a cluster locally, use port forwarding to make the Brigade API available via localhost:

**posix**

```
kubectl --namespace brigade2 port-forward service/brigade2-apiserver 8443:443 &>/dev/null &
```

**powershell**

```
& kubectl --namespace brigade2 port-forward service/brigade2-apiserver 8443:443 *> $null  
```

### Get External IP of a Remote Cluster

If you are running a cluster remotely, such as on a cloud provider, the Brigade API is available at the External IP of the brigade2-apiserver service:

```
kubectl get service --namespace brigade2 brigade2-apiserver -o=jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'
```

[Installation]: /intro/install/

## Log in to Brigade

Authenticate to Brigade as the root user using demo password `F00Bar!!!`. The \--insecure flag instructs Brigade to ignore the self-signed certificate used by our local installation of Brigade.

**local clusters**

```
brig login --insecure --server https://localhost:8443 --root
```

If the address https://localhost:8443 does not resolve, double-check that the brigade2-apiserver service was successfully forwarded from the previous section.

**remote clusters**

Replace `IP_ADDRESS` with the External IP address of your cluster:

```
brig login --insecure --server https://IP_ADDRESS --root
```

## Create a Project

A Brigade [project] defines event handlers, such as the definition of a CI pipeline.
In this example project, the handler prints a message using a string passed in the event payload.

1. Download the example project to the current directory.

    **posix**
    ```bash
    curl -o project.yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brigadecore/brigade/v2/examples/12-first-payload/project.yaml
    ```

    **powershell**
    ```bash
    (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brigadecore/brigade/v2/examples/12-first-payload/project.yaml", "$pwd\project.yaml")
    ```
1. Open project.yaml

    <script src="https://gist-it.appspot.com/https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brigadecore/brigade/v2/examples/12-first-payload/project.yaml"></script>

    The project defines a handler for the "exec" event, that reads the event payload string and prints it out with "Hello, PAYLOAD!".

1. Create the project in Brigade with the following command.

    ```
    brig project create --file project.yaml
    ```

1. List the defined projects with `brig project list` and verify that you see your new project:

    ```console
    $ brig project list
    ID           	DESCRIPTION                         	AGE
    first-payload	Demonstrates using the event payload	49m
    ```

[project]: /topics/projects/#an-introduction-to-projects

## Trigger an Event

With our project defined, you are now ready to trigger an event and watch your handler execute.

```
brig event create --project first-payload --payload Dolly --follow
```

Below is example output of a successful event handler:
```
Created event "7a5234d6-e2aa-402f-acb9-c620dfc20003".

Waiting for event's worker to be RUNNING...

```

## Cleanup

If you want to keep your Brigade installation, run the following command to remove the example project created in this QuickStart:

```
brig project delete first-payload
```

Otherwise, you can remove ALL resources created in this QuickStart by either:

* Deleting the KinD cluster that you created at the beginning with `kind delete cluster --name kind-kind` OR
* Preserving the cluster and uninstalling Brigade with `helm delete brigade2 -n brigade2`

## Next Steps

You now know how to install Brigade on a local development cluster, define a project, and trigger an event for the project.
Next learn how to [install and configure Brigade](/intro/install/) on a production cluster, or continue on to the [Read Next]
document where we review the more advanced topics to delve into.

[Read Next]: /readnext

## Troubleshooting

* [Brigade installation does not finish successfully](/intro/install/#troubleshooting)
* [Login command hangs](#login-command-hangs)

### Login command hangs

If the brig login command hangs, check that you included the -k flag.
This flag is required because our local development installation of Brigade is using a self-signed certificate.
