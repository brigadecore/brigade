# Brigade Project Developers

Users who interact with Brigade at the project-level are known as Project
Developers.

As a contrast to [Operators] who manage the Brigade system and [Administrators]
who manage users/accounts within the system, Project Developers are users
of Brigade itself.  They'll create and update [Projects], write [scripts] to
handle [Events] in the context of a project, view event logs, monitor event
progress and statuses via [brigterm] -- in short, harnessing the power of the
[brig] CLI to access all of the features around event-driven scripting that
Brigade provides.

Let's start off by creating [our first project][Projects].
