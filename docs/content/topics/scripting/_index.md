the major moving parts necessary to do so, including:

  * [Scripting guide] - An introduction to scripting concepts and examples
  * [Brigadier] - The JavaScript/TypeScript library for Brigade scripts
  * [Dependencies] - How to add/manage dependencies for a Brigade script
  * [Worker] - The default Brigade Worker that runs the logic encapsulated in
    Brigade scripts
  * [Advanced scripting guide] - A deeper dive into advanced scripting
    techniques
