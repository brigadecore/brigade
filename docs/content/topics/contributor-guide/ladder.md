This document outlines the different contributor roles within the Brigade
Project, along with their accompanying responsibilities and privileges.
Community members generally start at the first levels of the ladder and climb
the ladder as their involvement in the Project grows. Project Maintainers and
Core Maintainers are happy to do what they can to help anyone advance along the
contributor ladder.

> ⚠️&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout this document, "project" (with a lowercase "p") is
> used to denote individual software projects or source code repositories that
> are related in some way to Brigade and owned by the
> [@brigadecore](https://github.com/brigadecore) GitHub org. In contrast,
> "Project" (with an uppercase "P") is used to denote the entire breadth of
> Brigade as a "program" encompassing Brigade itself and _all_ related software
> projects or source code repositories owned by the __@brigadecore__ org.

## Community Participant

__Community Participant__ is the _de facto_ role for any Brigade user who ceases
to be anonymous and begins publicly interacting with the Brigade Community. Some
ways to become a Community Participant include, but are not limited to,
voluntarily:

* Participating in Community discussions (e.g. on Slack)
* Assisting other Community Participants
* Opening or commenting on issues
* Commenting on PRs
* Trying out new releases
* Attending Community events

All Community Participants must adhere to the
[CNCF Code of Conduct](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)

## Contributor

A __Contributor__ is a Community Participant who goes a step farther and
contributes _directly_ to moving the Brigade Project forward in some fashion.
All that is required to become a Contributor is to start contributing!
_Contributions do not need not be code._ Some ways to contribute include, but
are not limited to, voluntarily:

* Opening PRs containing code, documentation, or other content
  * Such contributions should adhere to our [Contributor Guide](./index.md)
* Using knowledge of Brigade to substantially assist other Community
  Participants
* Publicly promoting the Brigade Project

## Organization Member

An __Organization Member__ is an established and trusted Contributor who
contributes _regularly_ to the Brigade Project and has been granted membership
by the Core Maintainers in the __@brigadecore__ GitHub org.

An Organization Member must have:

* Made _several_ contributions to the Project
* Earned the trust of the Core Maintainers
* A _demonstrated need_ for org membership
  * Usually this will be because Core Maintainers have determined that the
    individual requires (and is trusted with) elevated permissions _vis-à-vis_
    one or more GitHub repositories belonging to the __@brigadecore__ GitHub
    org.

Privileges include:

* CI processes that run automatically for their PRs
* Authorizing CI processes to run for PRs from other Contributors

## Project Maintainer

Project Maintainers are established and trusted Contributors who are granted
broad responsibility for one or more, but not all, projects owned by the
__@brigadecore__ GitHub org. They are, generally, but not necessarily,
Organization Members. Project Maintainers (along with Core Maintainers) have
responsibility for ensuring the quality of code contributions by means of
conducting (or delegating) thorough reviews of PRs. This role includes write
and administrative access to applicable repositories.

Project Maintainers must:

* Have earned the trust of the Core Maintainers
* Exercise sound judgement for the good of their project(s) and the Project,
  independent of their employer's interests
* Contribute regularly to their project(s)
* Conduct PR reviews
* Mentor other Contributors
* Regularly participate in Community meetings

Privileges include:

* Publicly representing their respective project(s)
* Having a vote in matters affecting project direction, including the election
  of new Project Maintainers

Becoming a Project Maintainer for a given project requires a formal nomination
by one of that project's existing Maintainers _or_ a Core Maintainer. The
project's existing Maintainers and Core Maintainers are all eligible to vote.
Nominations and voting must occur publicly in an issue in the applicable GitHub
repository. Polling must remain open for a period of no less than two weeks or
until a simple majority is obtained.

## Core Maintainer

Core Maintainers are established Contributors who are granted broad and ultimate
responsibility for the _entirety_ of the Brigade Project. This role includes
write and administrative access to all projects owned by the __@brigadecore__
GitHub org and administrative access to the org itself.

Core Maintainers must:

* Must have earned the trust of the existing Core Maintainers
* Have made _extensive_ contributions to the Project
* Posses deep technical knowledge of Brigade
* Exercise sound judgement for the good the Project, independent of their
  employer's interests
* Contribute regularly to the Project
* Conduct PR reviews
* Mentor other Contributors
* Regularly participate in Community meetings

Privileges include:

* Publicly representing the Brigade Project
* Communicating with CNCF on behalf of the Project
* Stewardship of Project secrets (passwords, keys, etc.)
* Having a vote in matters affecting Project direction, including the election
  of new Project Maintainers and Core Maintainers

Becoming a Core Maintainer requires a formal nomination
by an existing Core Maintainer. All
existing Core Maintainers are all eligible to vote.
Nominations and voting must occur publicly in an issue in Brigade's
[main GitHub repository](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade). Polling must
remain open for a period of no less than two weeks or until a simple majority is
obtained.

## Maintainer Emeritus

__Maintainers Emeriti__ are individuals who have voluntarily stepped down from
the Core Maintainer role or been honorably discharged from that role by fellow
Core Maintainers due to inactivity or competing commitments. The Project owes a
debt of gratitude to these individuals and their re-ascension of the contributor
ladder may be fast-tracked if or when their routine contributions to the Project
resume.

## Involuntary Removal of Maintainers

Involuntary removal/demotion of Project Maintainers or Core Maintainers may
occur if such an individual is unable to meet their responsibilities, as
described by this document.

As a professional courtesy, any Project Maintainer or Core Maintainer that is
the subject of potential involuntary removal will be asked first to step down
voluntarily.

The process for involuntary removal mirrors the process for Project Maintainer
and Core Maintainer nominations and elections. The process must occur publicly
in an issue of a applicable GitHub repository and polling must remain open for a
period of no less than two weeks or until a simple majority of the eligible
voters has been obtained. Any Project Maintainer or Core Maintainer that is
the subject of potential involuntary removal is ineligible to vote in the matter
of their removal.
