This contributor guide is intended as a comprehensive introduction for
developers who are looking to get involved with contributing directly to the
Brigade project itself. Those wishing to contribute to other Brigade-related
projects -- event gateways, for instance -- are also likely to find value in
this documentation, as the maintainers have worked hard to ensure a consistent
developer experience across all projects.

This guide is decomposed into the following, high-level topics:

- [Contribution Workflow](workflow)
- [Signing Commits](signing)
- [Hacking on Brigade](hacking)
- [Releasing Brigade](releasing)
- [Contributor Ladder](ladder)
- [Code Review Guide](reviewing)
