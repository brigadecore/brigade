# Brigade Administrators

Users who are in charge of authentication and authorization concerns within the
Brigade system are known as Administrators.

They'll select a supported third-party authentication strategy to plug into
Brigade as well as configure Service Account, User and Role authorization
strategies.

  * [Authentication]: Here we discuss the supported authentication strategies
    and configuration in Brigade

  * [Authorization]: Here we discuss setting authorization within Brigade,
    including creation and management of Service Accounts, Users and Roles
