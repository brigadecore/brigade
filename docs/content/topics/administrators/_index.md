# Brigade Administrators

Users who are in charge of authentication and authorization concerns within the
Brigade system are known as Administrators.

They'll select a supported third-party authentication strategy that an
[Operator] can configure when deploying Brigade, as well as be in charge of
configuring Service Account, User and Role authorization strategies within
Brigade.

  * [Authentication]: Here we discuss the supported authentication strategies
    and configuration in Brigade

  * [Authorization]: Here we discuss setting authorization within Brigade,
    including creation and management of Service Accounts, Users and Roles
