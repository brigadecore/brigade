# Brigade Administrators

Users who are in charge of authentication and authorization concerns within the
Brigade system are known as Administrators.

They'll select a supported third-party authentication strategy that an
[Operator] can configure when deploying Brigade, as well as be in charge of
configuring Service Account, User and Role authorization strategies within
Brigade.

On account of this overlap of responsibilities between an Administrator and
Operator, a common scenario is that both roles are filled by the same user.

  * [Authentication]: Here we discuss the supported authentication strategies
    and configuration in Brigade

  * [Authorization]: Here we discuss setting authorization within Brigade,
    including creation and management of Service Accounts, Users and Roles
